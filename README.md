# Physics-Web-App

## Objective 

The objective of this project is to create an interactive website that allows the user to experiment with and learn about complex physical and chemical process. Like thermodynamics, Quantum mechaninces(QM), Genral Reletively(GR), and other theorys and idea's like the big bang theory, dark matter and the growing universe, and Newtons laws of motion. 


## How To 

To do this project I will be using both backend and frontend programs. On the backend python will be used to run calculations and show theories. On the frontend HTML, CSS, and Javascript will be used to develop the website and it's interactive features. Each topic will get it's own html file.
